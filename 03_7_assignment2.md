## Code a classification prediction task

This example is a species distribution model. The goal of this assignment is to find the best performing KNN model to predict the presence or absence of the Willow Tit, a bird native to Switzerland, using elevation as a predictor. This data set is from Royle JA & Dorazio RM (2008) Hierarchical Modeling and Inference in Ecology, p 87. Elevation (altitude) data are from [USGS-EROS](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros). To focus on understanding how the KNN model algorithm expresses a nonlinear function of the predictors, we'll consider a single predictor variable.

The code below is R. Corresponding Python code is in `assignment2.py`.

The data are in the `data` directory:

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Read in the data
willowtit <- read.csv("data/wtmatrix.csv") |> 
    mutate(status=ifelse(y.1==1, "present", "absent")) |> 
    select(status, elev)
head(willowtit)

# Summary
willowtit |> 
    group_by(bin=cut(elev, breaks=seq(0, 3000, by=500), dig.lab=4), status) |> 
    summarize(p=n()) 
```



**Q1\.** Based on the code in `classification_knn.R` that we worked through in class:

- [ ] Form predictions (present or absent) for the KNN model for a grid of elevations from min(elev) to max(elev) for various values of `k_knn` (number of nearest neighbors). Explore values of `k_knn` and choose a set of `k_knn` values to visualize next that helps you understand the consequences of changing `k_knn`.

- [ ] Visualize these predictions (present or absent) as a function of elevation. How might you visualize these? This requires some thought as the raw predictions are category labels (a character vector). Here's one suggestion: plot elevation on the x axis with predicted category on the y-axis. Jitter the points on the y-axis to separate them out a bit. Put different values of k_knn in different panels. Perhaps you have a better idea! You're welcome to come up with your own visualization.

**Q2.** Make a new function, called `knn_classify2_probs`, by modifying the `knn_classify2` function so that instead of returning a character vector of the predictions, it returns a numeric vector of the probabilities. To do this, you should work through the existing function line-by-line to understand its flow. Hint: the solution is to remove some lines of code. Also, the KNN function predicts the probability of `cat1`, which in this case could be absence, so be sure to include code that returns always (in the general case, not just this dataset) the probability of presence.

- [ ] Include updated documentation for this function, i.e. don't just leave the original documentation (comments) because that doesn't apply any more!
- [ ] Use this function to form predicted probabilities for various values of `k_knn`. Visualize these predictions in a scatterplot of probability as a function of elevation. Specifically, make plots for `k_knn` = 1, 5, 25, 100.
- [ ] Describe how the shape of the function changes with `k_knn`.
- [ ] Comment on how the value of `k_knn` influences the flexibility of the function and it's likely bias and variance (i.e. consider the bias-variance tradeoff in the context of classification); e.g. one of these models is likely a better balance between bias and variance because it represents the prediction smoothly yet relatively closely.

**Q3.** Tune the KNN model algorithm using the CV inference algorithm. Specifically, using the original `knn_classify2` function, and based on the code in `classification_knn.R`, find the best predictive KNN model using 5, 10, and n-fold CV. Hint: be sure to search adequately across the possible range of `k_knn`. You want to see the error go down, and then go back up again. If the error is not obviously changing much, you've probably got more parameter space to explore.

- [ ] Comment on the stability of the CV plot for a single k-fold run, i.e. how does it vary across runs?
- [ ] Investigate a multiple replicate run of CV for 5, 10, and n-fold CV to stabilize the plot (this may take a while to run)
- [ ] What value of `k_knn` would you choose for good predictive performance? Justify your choice.

**Q4.** Visualize probability versus elevation for the best model.

- [ ] Comment on the shape of this relationship
- [ ] Color code the two categories (presence, absence) in this plot and add a horizontal line at probability = 0.5. From the plot, what is the approximate elevation range of predicted presence?
- [ ] Why are there no predicted presences below probability = 0.5?

**Q5.** Make a map of where the Willow Tit is predicted to be.

- [ ] Do the predictions make sense? Briefly describe why the spatial pattern of predictions in the map makes sense.



To get you started on making a map, here is code to read in and plot elevation data (digital elevation model, DEM) for Switzerland.

```R
swissdem <- read.csv("data/switzerland_tidy.csv")

ggplot(swissdem) +
    geom_raster(aes(x=x, y=y, fill=Elev_m)) +
    scale_fill_gradientn(colors=terrain.colors(22), name="Elevation (m)") + 
    coord_quickmap() +
    labs(title="Switzerland: DEM") +
    theme_void() +
    theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, vjust=-2))
```

Here is how we could overlay the predicted presences of the Willow Tit on the DEM. First add a column to `swissdem` indicating the **predicted** presence/absence status. Call the column, say, `pred_status`. To provide working code *for illustration only*, I've hard coded an elevation range here just so we have a vector called `pred_status` to plot onto a map.

```R
swissdem <- swissdem |> 
    mutate(pred_status=ifelse(Elev_m > 800 & Elev_m < 1200, "present", "absent"))
```

You wouldn't use this code at all! Instead, add a `pred_status` column of model predictions to `swissdem` containing the predicted presence-absence status (e.g. using `cbind()`).  To do that, you'll need to first feed the elevations in `swissdem` to the KNN model to make the predictions.

Now add the predicted status using a `geom_tile()` layer to make an overlay. We can filter to just the presences so absences are blank, and use an `alpha` setting  of say, 0.6, for some transparency. The overlaid presences will appear in the map as a light shade of blue.

```R
ggplot() +
    geom_raster(data=swissdem,
                aes(x=x, y=y, fill=Elev_m)) +
    scale_fill_gradientn(colors=terrain.colors(22), name="Elevation (m)") +
    geom_tile(data=filter(swissdem, pred_status=="present"), 
              aes(x=x, y=y), fill="blue", 
              alpha=0.6) +
    coord_quickmap() +
    labs(title="Predicted distribution of Willow Tit in Switzerland") +
    theme_void() +
    theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, vjust=-2))
```

You might try other color schemes. For example, `scale_fill_viridis_c()` with a pink overlay looks pretty good to me too.



**Optional advanced ggplot for R:** The above default `ggplot` does not include a legend or color scale for presence-absence. There is a bit of extra work to add legends for both elevation and presence-absence. Here is one way of doing it using `scale_fill_manual()` and the package `ggnewscale`.

```r
library(ggnewscale)

ggplot() +
    geom_raster(data=swissdem,
                aes(x=x, y=y, fill=Elev_m)) +
    scale_fill_gradientn(colors=terrain.colors(22), name="Elevation (m)") +
    new_scale_fill() +
    geom_tile(data=filter(swissdem, status=="present"), 
              aes(x=x, y=y, fill="Present"), 
              alpha=0.6) +
    scale_fill_manual(name="Willow Tit", 
                      breaks=c("Present"), 
                      values=c("Present"="blue")) +
    coord_quickmap() +
    labs(title="Predicted distribution of Willow Tit in Switzerland") +
    theme_void() +
    theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5, vjust=-2))
```
