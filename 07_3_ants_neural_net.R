#' A single layer neural network, or feedforward network, illustrated with the
#' ants data. We first hand code the model algorithm as a proof of
#' understanding. Then we code the same model and train it using Keras.

#' Ant data with 3 predictors of species richness

ants <- read.csv("data/ants.csv") |> 
    select(richness, latitude, habitat, elevation)
head(ants)

#' For neural networks it is customary to scale numeric predictors to zero mean,
#' unit variance, as the training algorithms perform better. To make predictions
#' with new data, we need to use the scaling parameters from the data used to
#' train the model. Here, we calculate the scaling parameters (mean and standard
#' deviation) to use later.

lat_mn <- mean(ants$latitude)
lat_sd <- sd(ants$latitude)
ele_mn <- mean(ants$elevation)
ele_sd <- sd(ants$elevation)


#' ### Hand-coded feedforward network

#' Before we go on to Keras, we're going to hand code a feedforward network in R
#' to gain a good understanding of the model algorithm. Here is our pseudocode
#' from the lecture notes.
#' 

#' ```
#' Single layer neural network, model algorithm:
#'
#' define g(z)
#' load X, i=1...n, j=1...p (in appropriate form)
#' set K
#' set weights and biases: w(1)_jk, b(1)_k, w(2)_k1, b(2)_1
#' for each activation unit k in 1:K
#'     calculate linear predictor: z_k = b(1)_k + Xw(1)_k
#'     calculate nonlinear activation: A_k = g(z_k)
#' calculate linear model: f(X) = b(2)_1 + Aw(2)_1
#' return f(X)
#' ```
#' 

#' Now code this algorithm in R. I already trained this model using Keras (see
#' later) to obtain a parameter set for the weights and biases.

# Single layer neural network, model algorithm

# define g(z)
g_relu <- function(z) {
    g_z <- ifelse(z < 0, 0, z)
    return(g_z)
}

# load x (could be a grid of new predictor values or the original data)
grid_data  <- expand.grid(
    latitude=seq(min(ants$latitude), max(ants$latitude), length.out=201),
    habitat=c("forest","bog"),
    elevation=seq(min(ants$elevation), max(ants$elevation), length.out=51))

# data preparation: scale, one-hot encoding, convert to matrix
x <- grid_data |>
    mutate(latitude = (latitude - lat_mn) / lat_sd,
           elevation = (elevation - ele_mn) / ele_sd,
           bog = ifelse(habitat == "bog", 1, 0),
           forest = ifelse(habitat == "forest", 1, 0)) |>    
    select(latitude, bog, forest, elevation) |>     #drop richness & habitat
    as.matrix()

# dimensions of x
n <- nrow(x)
p <- ncol(x)

# set K
K <- 5

# set parameters (weights and biases)

#' ### Using Keras to fit neural networks

#' Now we'll consider the very same model with Keras, including training the
#' model on the data to determine the weight and bias parameters.
#' 

#' You'll need to install Python and Tensorflow to use the `keras` package. The
#' `keras` package is an R interface to the Python Keras library, which in turn
#' is an interface to the Python Tensorflow library, which in turn is an
#' interface to Tensorflow (mostly C++)! See Assignment 4 for installation
#' directions. The Python Keras library is widely used and the R functions and
#' workflow closely mirror the Python functions and workflow, so what we'll
#' learn in Keras for R largely applies to Keras for Python as well. See also
#' the Python version of this script.
#' 

#+ warning=FALSE
# If you have another conda environment as your R default, you will need the
# following line before loading the keras library
reticulate::use_condaenv(condaenv = "r-tensorflow")
library(keras)

#' First we'll set a random seed for reproducibility. The seed applies to R,
#' Python, and Tensorflow. It will take a few moments for Tensorflow to get set
#' up.

tensorflow::set_random_seed(5574)

#' Next, prepare the data (the predictors are prepared exactly as we did for the
#' hand-coded version above):
 
xtrain <- ants |> 
    mutate(latitude = (latitude - lat_mn) / lat_sd,
           elevation = (elevation - ele_mn) / ele_sd,
           bog = ifelse(habitat == "bog", 1, 0),
           forest = ifelse(habitat == "forest", 1, 0)) |>    
    select(latitude, bog, forest, elevation) |>     #drop richness & habitat
    as.matrix()

ytrain <- ants[,"richness"]

#' Next, specify the model. The basic syntax builds the model layer by layer,
#' using the pipe operator to express the flow of information from the output of
#' one layer to the input of the next. Here, `keras_model_sequential()` says we
#' will build a sequential (or feedforward) network and the input layer will
#' have `ncol(xtrain)` units (i.e. there will be one input unit, or node, for
#' each of the 4 predictor columns in our ant data). The next layer, a hidden
#' layer, will be a densely-connected layer (i.e. all units from the previous
#' layer connected to all units of the hidden layer) with 5 units, and it will
#' be passed through the ReLU activation function. The output layer will be
#' another densely-connected layer with 1 unit and no activation applied.

modnn1 <- keras_model_sequential(input_shape = ncol(xtrain)) |>
    layer_dense(units = 5) |>
    layer_activation("relu") |> 
    layer_dense(units = 1)

#' We can check the configuration:

modnn1

#' The model and layer names, such as "dense_1" and "activation" are names
#' given to the objects created in the tensorflow workspace for this R session.
#' We see that layer 1 has 25 parameters as we expect (5x4 weights and 5 biases)
#' and the output layer has 6 parameters as we expect (5 weights and 1 bias).
#' This model thus has a total of 31 parameters.
#' 

#' Next, compile the model. We are specifying that the optimizer algorithm is
#' RMSprop and the loss function is mean squared error. Notice that we are not
#' modifying the R `modnn1` object but are instead directing Keras in Python to
#' set up for training the model.

compile(modnn1, optimizer="rmsprop", loss="mse")

#' The RMSprop algorithm is the default in Keras and works for most models. It
#' implements stochastic gradient descent with an adaptive learning rate and
#' various performance enhancements. By default, the initial learning rate is
#' 0.001 (see `?optimizer_rmsprop`) but this can be tuned. Other optimizers are
#' available.
#'

#' Now train the model, keeping a copy of the training history. Again, we are
#' not getting a new R fitted-model object out of this as we would in, say, a
#' call to `fit()` with an `lm` object but instead we are directing Keras in
#' Python to train the model (all the important output remains in Python data
#' structures). The history object is a by-product of training, so I put it on
#' the right-hand side of the expression to be clear that this is a by-product
#' and not a traditional R fitted-model object (where you would usually expect
#' to find the trained parameter values). In one epoch, the training data are
#' sampled in batches (one SGD step is taken for each batch) until all of the
#' data have been sampled, so the number of epochs is the number of complete
#' iterations through the training data. I chose 300 epochs because the fit
#' improves only slowly beyond that. Here I used a batch size of 4, which means
#' 10% of the data are used on each subsample to calculate the stochastic
#' gradient descent step. Training will take a minute or so and a plot will
#' chart its progress.

#+ eval=FALSE

fit(modnn1, xtrain, ytrain, epochs = 300, batch_size=4) -> history

#' As it takes time to train these models, it's worth saving the model
#' (Tensorflow format) and history (R format) so they they can be reloaded
#' later. We can also load this saved model in Python or share with colleagues.

# save_model_tf(modnn1, "07_3_ants_neural_net_files/saved/modnn1")
# save(history, file="07_3_ants_neural_net_files/saved/modnn1_history.Rdata")
modnn1 <- load_model_tf("07_3_ants_neural_net_files/saved/modnn1")
load("07_3_ants_neural_net_files/saved/modnn1_history.Rdata")

#' We can plot the history once training is done. If you have `ggplot2` loaded,
#' it will create a ggplot, otherwise it will create a base plot.

plot(history, smooth=FALSE, theme_bw=TRUE)

#' We want to see the training error (RMS) decline to a reasonable level.
#' Although the error will continue to go down, here we see it leveling out
#' somewhat at about RMS=7, which is an absolute error of sqrt(7) = +/- 2.6
#' species.
#' 

#' Make predictions for our grid of new predictor variables (`x`; we made this
#' earlier, scaling by the mean and sd of the data) and plot the fitted model
#' with the data. This plot is exactly the same as the one we produced earlier
#' "by hand" since they are the same model.
