#' To demonstrate transfer learning we'll continue to use the ecological subset
#' of the CIFAR100 data and compare a transfer learning approach to our
#' previous model trained from scratch.

#' For transfer learning, we'll use the VGG16 model, which is a convolutional
#' neural network trained on 1.2 million images from the ImageNet benchmark
#' image database. Load the VGG16 pretrained model and examine its architecture.
#' It is similar to the CNN model we fitted from scratch but has two
#' convolutional layers in a row in each convolution block. The output is a
#' prediction of 1000 categories.

#' First, let's try using VGG16 to predict the label for an image from wikipedia
#' (an elephant). Keras has a few helper functions to prepare the image so that
#' it's suitable for input to the VGG16 model. It needs to be the correct size
#' and in an array with the correct dimensions. The format of the ImageNet
#' dataset has color channels in a different order (BGR instead of RGB) and a
#' different scaling for the channel levels, which we change using a
#' `preprocess` helper function provided in keras.

img_inet <- imagenet_preprocess_input(img_inet)

#' This is the image

plot(as.raster(img / 255))

#' Now feed the prepared image to the CNN for prediction. First we get a column
#' matrix of the scores (probabilities) for each of the 1000 categories.

pred <- predict(vgg16, img_inet)

#' Now we can print the top 5 predictions (5 most probable) with a Keras
#' function that looks up the category names. The prediction is spot on.

#' Now let's consider our CIFAR56eco dataset with this VGG16 pretrained model.
#' In the previous script we prepared the dataset.

load("data_large/cifar56eco.RData")

#' Out of curiosity, let's plot a random selection of predictions using the
#' pretrained model to see what it would predict out of the box for our
#' CIFAR56eco images. To feed our 32 x 32 images to VGG16, we need to match the
#' input image size (VGG16 needs 224 x 224).

    text(0, 26, paste("actual =", eco_labels$name[y_test[i,]+1]), col="red", pos=4)
} 

#' The 1000 VGG16 categories are quite different to the 56 categories we want to
#' predict in the CIFAR56eco data so we're not going to expect good predictions
#' unless there is a large degree of overlap in the categories. Nevertheless, we
#' see that a few images are correctly classified, some others are close, and we
#' can understand why some of the other predictions are as they are.
#' 

#' ## Transfer learning set up and training

#' Set up a model to predict our 56 ecological categories by disconnecting the
#' convolutional base from the pretrained VGG16 model. In keras we can do this
#' by specifying `include_top=FALSE`.

vgg16_base <- application_vgg16(weights="imagenet", include_top=FALSE, 
                                input_shape=c(224, 224, 3))

#' We can think of this pretrained convolutional base as a skilled feature
#' extraction tool. It takes a 224 x 224 image and extracts features. The final
#' output is a 7 x 7 x 512 array, which equals 25088 features.

vgg16_base

#' We then freeze the weights so these won't be trained further, and add
#' a single-layer feedforward network for our 56 ecological categories (the same
#' architecture we used in our model trained from scratch). Instead of resizing
#' all the images in our image array, which would use a lot of memory, we have
#' specified the input image size to be the same as the original images but have
#' included a resizing layer in the network.

#' Plot the training history. Again, we see evidence of overfitting after a few
#' epochs as the validation loss climbs. Nevertheless, the training accuracy
#' continues to improve but is mostly done after about 15 epochs, climbing to
#' about 60%.

plot(history, smooth=FALSE)

#' Why do the validation loss and accuracy loss give different signals? The
#' validation loss is accounting for accuracy in the predicted probability
#' across all of the categories, whereas the accuracy loss is only assessing the
#' single predicted category. This pattern suggests we have more parameters in
#' the model than we need for accurate prediction, so this model is not
#' efficient.
#' 

#' For the out-of-sample prediction accuracy we'll check predictions against the
#' hold-out test set. Prediction is also best done on GPU. This will take about
#' 15 mins on CPU but seconds on GPU.

#' improving from 42% in our model trained from scratch. We got a considerable
#' improvement from transfer learning!

} 

#' It's impressive that we can predict the category for many of these low
#' quality images. There are also some notable misses, such as the elephant
#' predicted to be "cattle".
#' 

#' This model is a first pass. It surely has too many parameters and is not
#' efficient. Things to try next would be to reduce the size of the hidden layer
#' in the feedforward network, or eliminate it altogether. It's also not clear
#' how much of the improved predictive performance is due to transfer learning
#' versus the different VGG16 architecture. We could also try fitting the VGG16
#' convolutional layers from scratch but the advantage of transfer learning is
#' that we don't have to do that. As another thing to try, we could unfreeze
#' some of the convolution blocks (typically the later ones) and fine tune
#' those.
#'

#' Finally, the training approach here applies generally to more complex
#' variations of this model (e.g. we could include further regularization
#' strategies such as data augmentation) but it is not the most efficient way to
#' train this uncomplicated model. A more efficient approach would break the
#' training into two phases: 1) use `vgg16_base` to extract and save the
#' features from the training set, 2) train the feedforward network, where the
#' inputs are the extracted features. This training approach is very fast in
#' comparison and is feasible on CPU.
